The histology platform, running under the responsibility of F. Geffroy from the “MIDAS” research group, consists in a technical facility dedicated to the histopathological analysis of animal models currently under investigation in several preclinical projects. This facility provides all equipment and techniques required for histological data acquisition, starting from biological samples preparation until their analysis with fluorescence microscopy. To meet the users’ needs, the histology platform offers a wide range of experimental protocols:

- organs harvesting, intracardiac perfusion

- cryoprotection with sucrose, freezing with isopentane

- cryomicrotomy to acquire histological slices

- slices collection on glass slides before storage at -30°C or -80°C

- set-up of immunohistochemical (simple or multiple) and histochemical stainings

- visualization of histological stainings using bright-field or fluorescence microscopy

The cell culture platform of NeuroSpin, running under the responsibility of F. Geffroy from the “MIDAS” research group, consists in a technical facility dedicated to the preparation of specific cell lines that are required to induce brain tumors in animal models currently under investigation in several preclinical projects. This facility provides all equipment and techniques required for cell culture:

- a specific cryopreservation system for storing different cell lines of brain tumors (U87, C6, 9L, Gl261…)

- a specific biological safety cabinet to handle cells in a clean working environment

- a specific incubator to ensure cells growth in a strictly controlled CO2 environment

- a specific binocular microscope for visualization of living cells
